# Download DigiVatLib pdf

[![Using Zotero Plugin Template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Using-Zotero%20Plugin%20Template-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-plugin-template)

## Use case
This is a [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) plugin (also called add-on) for downloading whole manuscripts as pdfs from [DigiVatLib](https://digi.vatlib.it/).

## How to use
To install the plugin you have to download the `.xpi`-File from the [releases page](https://github.com/theRatramnus/Zotero-download-DigiVatLib-pdf/releases). A guide on how to install Zotero add-ons can be found [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins).
###
When you've done that just navigate to a DigiVatLib manuscript's page, like this one: [https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.lat.3225](https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.lat.3225) and click the Zotero Connector Button. The plugin will ask you which pages you'd like to download from 0 (first page) to the final page. When you click "done" the download will start and the pdf will be automatically attached to the new library entry.

## Known issues / Limitations
The plugin struggles with huge pdf files (like 700 pages), but works fine with samller sizes (like 250 pages). Consider downloading multiple smaller chunks and combining them into one pdf after the fact.
###
I don't take any responsibility for this plugin breaking your Zotero library.
